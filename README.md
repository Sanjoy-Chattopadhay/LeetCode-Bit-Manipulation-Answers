# Bit Manipulation Problems

Welcome to the Bit Manipulation Problems repository! This collection is dedicated to solving various problems using bitwise operations, which are fundamental for optimizing performance and solving complex algorithmic challenges efficiently.

## Overview

Bit manipulation is a powerful technique that leverages binary representations of data to perform operations directly on bits. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive set of problems and solutions to help you master bitwise operations.

## Contents

- **Basic Operations**: Introduction to bitwise AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and shift operations.
- **Common Patterns**: Examples and solutions to frequently encountered bit manipulation patterns.
- **Advanced Problems**: Challenging problems that require a deep understanding of bitwise operations.
- **Interview Questions**: A curated list of bit manipulation questions commonly asked in technical interviews.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and explore the problems in the `problems` directory. Each problem comes with a detailed explanation and a step-by-step solution.

```bash
gh repo clone Sanjoy-Chattopadhay/LeetCode-Bit-Manipulation-Answers
